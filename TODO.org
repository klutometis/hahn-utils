* TODO Add a link to salmonella-testing.
* TODO Need to have an =@example= with explicit extensions.
  =Sicp-eval=, for instance, breaks =@example=; should we have an
  =@example-with-extensions= that takes a list of extensions?

  Or can we have a =@use= (or =@extensions=) special-form?

  Should be able to define an =@extensions= special-form; in the
  absence of which: use the documented behavior of included all seen
  modules.

  Should that really be the default? Or should we force an
  =(@extensions all)=?
* TODO Think about preambles with =@example=.
  Maybe =@eval-modules=? It’s a little distracting to have to issue
  e.g. =(require-extension test)= in the examples.

  Or maybe they should be self-contained?

  Another implication is that cock must be aware of the module (i.e.
  the module must be documented and included in the cock-invocation).
* TODO Create a test-creation mechanism.

  Otherwise, use a =@(release “tag” “message”)= directive.

  More and more, it’s looking like we’ll have to have access to the
  egg dir itself; if it’s not in =(current-directory)=. There, we can
  find things like =.meta=, =.release-info=, &c.; and determine
  whether or not it’s a repo.

  This, as opposed to a manifold of choices.

  You know what, though? That’s a pain in the ass; can we please
  mandate current working directory?

  Or do we want all the commit messages that belong to that tag and
  call it a changelog?

  See [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8136178/git-log-between-tags][this]] for git; [[http://www.bernzilla.com/item.php?id%3D613][this]] for svn; this could be a verbose option?

  For the time being, let’s allow the specification of command-line
  driven heuristics, should the detection fail.

  Problem is, =cock= expects to be run from the root of the egg; the
  repo-heuristics, on the other hand, from the repo root. In the case
  of e.g. =svn=, those diverge.

  =cock --svn=..=, for instance; since in e.g.
  =chicken-eggs/chicken-doc/trunk=, a generic =cock --repo=..= will
  fail.

  Or, fuck it: use things like the return value of =svn status=.

  Probably need an example-header that knows to e.g. ...; no, let's
  have =@egg= instead of =@title=. We'll use the egg for title, and we
  have the added benefit of knowing what the egg is called. This we
  could eventually harvest from <egg>.meta, too.

  Can we add this to the =wiki-write-block=?

  Let's use =@internal=. Or: instead of =@<identifier>=, we should
  reuse the keyword mechanism? Principle of least surprise? Would look
  like: =internal:=. All the asperands are alien, I think.

  On the other hand, how would you document keywords? No, we have to
  resort to something noisy.

  Instead of using strings (which will be given verbatim), can't we
  have some sort of ad-hoc s-expression-based markup? E.g.:

  #+BEGIN_SRC scheme
    @(This is (em some) (_ markup).
      (arg "Argument"))
  #+END_SRC

  Meh; we have no good way to differentiate argument lists. Fuck it:
  let's go [[http://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/4/lowdown][markdown]].

  (See the defunct [[https://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/4/multidoc][multidoc]], by the way.)

  It's going to be a pain-in-the-ass to distinguish between intra- and
  inter-document links, isn't it? How I wish I could defer to the
  renderer.
